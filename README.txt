RUTransit  is a train reservation system. It is an online railway booking system that allows customers to book train reservations and view their reservations. It also allows another group of people, "customer representatives," to assist customers in making reservations. Lastly, it will enable an admin to add more customer representatives, monitor sales, and view all aspects of the reservation/booking system to ensure that it is functional. This system is built with the use of Java, HTML, MySQL, and JDBC to create an interface on a local server. We will have a demo video to see more about the functionality of the project.

Below is some credential information already in the system and can be used to test it out. The system allows for registering more customers and customer representatives on the local server directly but not another admin account.
